INTRODUCTION.


_As an apology for the present undertaking, the Author has only to
observe, that the very great encouragement he has received in his folio
edition of the_ ERICAS, _joined with the repeated application of many of
its subscribers, for a small, concise, and pleasant reference to that
beautiful and extensive tribe, has induced him to offer to the amateurs
of plants in general, the present Monograph; in which will be given all
the known species, and likewise all those successively that may
hereafter be introduced; with Latin and English descriptions,
dissections, &c. on the same plan as the folio work_.

_The Author therefore hopes it will be regarded as an agreeable
green-house companion, calculated to preserve the folio edition for the
use of the library, to which on account of its size it is best adapted._

_When one volume is completed, every necessary requisite for binding
will be given._




A SHORT DISSERTATION.


This beautiful and extended tribe of plants, at present so much admired
and cultivated in our British Gardens, is but of recent introduction, at
least the major part of them, as antecedent to the year 1772 the few
species then known were the E. vulgaris, E. Tetralix, E. cinerea, and E.
vagans, natives; the E. Dabœcii, from Ireland; the E. arborea from
Madeira in 1748; the E. herbacea or carnea in 1763 from Switzerland; the
E. mediterranea in 1765 from Minorca; the E. scoparia, E.
viridi-purpurea, E. australis, E. ciliaris, and E. umbellata, from
Portugal, between the years 1768 and 1707. The two other European
species we possess, the E. stricta, and E. multiflora, natives of Spain,
have been but 14 years in cultivation with us; and the African species
found within the district of the Cape of Good Hope and the adjacent
territory, which have swelled the Genus to so great an extent, and by
the extreme brilliance of their flowers have contributed so much to the
present splendour of our green-houses, were unknown to our English
botanists, but by name, till the above æra. In the year 1772 seeds of
two species were sent from the Cape.--Both vegetated. The first was the
E. tubiflora of the Sp. Plant. of Linnæus, the other the E. concinna. In
1774 the superb collection at Kew was enriched by nearly 20 species sent
by Mr. F. Masson, His Majesty’s collector at the Cape, for which we
refer to the 2nd vol. of the Catalogue of that garden. From this period,
till within these few years, the accession has been so rapid, so many
different collectors producing new species, that it would be only a list
of names to enumerate them, and no way illustrate the present subject;
nor would it be any way relevant to the subject, to know how many were
enumerated by Petiver, Plukenet, Hermann, Oldenland, Ray, &c. &c. as,
before Linnæus had by his mode of classification determined the precise
limits of the Genus, the confusion that then pervaded all the elder
botanists is such, that any comment from them would rather perplex than
elucidate. Therefore, beginning with the Systema Naturæ of Linnæus, vol.
ii. of 1767, including the European species, he there enumerates but 42;
and Dahlgren, in 1770, edited a dissertation (under his inspection) on
the Genus, containing a catalogue of 58 names from Bergius, the
Mantissa, &c. Thunberg, on his return from Africa, added 13 to the
number, all of which were inserted in the Supplementum Plantarum of
1781. From this and some other sources Murray has in his Syst. Veg. of
1784 made a list of 74 names, and Martyn in his edition of Miller’s
Dictionary, 1795, enumerates but 84. Willdenow, collating from all the
foregoing, &c., has mounted the list to 137 in his Species Plantarum.
This is certainly far short of the number at present cultivated in
Britain; and from the variety of beautiful new specimens and seeds
lately received by G. Hibbert, Esq. from his collector at the Cape, many
of which have vegetated and are in high perfection at the Clapham
Gardens, we may fairly conjecture that the Genus is by no means bounded
by the species we at present possess.




MODE OF CULTURE.


Very few, if any, of the species, but have been increased by cuttings.
The only method we shall therefore treat of is this, and by seeds. The
process for making and planting the cuttings is as follows: Let a
middle-sized pot be prepared by filling it within three inches of the
margin with small broken potsherds, or some such matter, that there may
be a constant and ready drain for the water, which it will be necessary
to give the cuttings at any time when the earth appears dry. Then,
consulting the Index, take a sufficient quantity of sandy loam, sandy
peat, or common sand, or a mixture of any of them, finely sifted, to
fill the pot up to the margin, and press it lightly with the hand. Thus
prepared, it is fit to receive the cuttings. These must be taken about
an inch long, or shorter, from the smallest and tenderest shoots,
cutting off the leaves two-thirds of the length, close to the shoot.
When a few are thus made ready, take a small pointed piece of wood and
dibble them into the pot; fixing the lower end of the cutting as firm as
possible. When the pot is filled with them at about half an inch
distance each way, cover them with a small bell-glass, to fit as near as
possible. Then place it under a large hand-glass, or frame, where it
must be kept from the stronger rays of the sun till the cuttings are
rooted. Soon after the small bell-glass must be first removed, and in a
week they may be exposed to the open air in the shade of a north wall,
or, in winter, in the shady part of the green-house, to protect them
from the sun and winds till they are removed into separate pots. The
seeds of some species which ripen in this country, as well as those
procured from the Cape, may be sown about the middle of March, in pots
prepared the same way as for the cuttings; with this exception, that the
earth be invariably sandy peat finely sifted. The seeds should be very
slightly covered, and watered with a pot whose rose or head should only
admit the water like a light dew, lest the seeds be all washed together.
The smallest pots that can be procured are the best for transplanting.
The earth in which most Heaths thrive best is a soft, loose, sandy
peat.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
