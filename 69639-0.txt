INTRODUCTION.


_As an apology for the present undertaking, the Author has only to
observe, that the very great encouragement he has received in his folio
edition of the_ ERICAS, _joined with the repeated application of many of
its subscribers, for a small, concise, and pleasant reference to that
beautiful and extensive tribe, has induced him to offer to the amateurs
of plants in general, the present Monograph; in which will be given all
the known species, and likewise all those successively that may
hereafter be introduced; with Latin and English descriptions,
dissections, &c. on the same plan as the folio work_.

_The Author therefore hopes it will be regarded as an agreeable
green-house companion, calculated to preserve the folio edition for the
use of the library, to which on account of its size it is best adapted._

_When one volume is completed, every necessary requisite for binding
will be given._




A SHORT DISSERTATION.


This beautiful and extended tribe of plants, at present so much admired
and cultivated in our British Gardens, is but of recent introduction, at
least the major part of them, as antecedent to the year 1772 the few
species then known were the E. vulgaris, E. Tetralix, E. cinerea, and E.
vagans, natives; the E. Dabœcii, from Ireland; the E. arborea from
Madeira in 1748; the E. herbacea or carnea in 1763 from Switzerland; the
E. mediterranea in 1765 from Minorca; the E. scoparia, E.
viridi-purpurea, E. australis, E. ciliaris, and E. umbellata, from
Portugal, between the years 1768 and 1707. The two other European
species we possess, the E. stricta, and E. multiflora, natives of Spain,
have been but 14 years in cultivation with us; and the African species
found within the district of the Cape of Good Hope and the adjacent
territory, which have swelled the Genus to so great an extent, and by
the extreme brilliance of their flowers have contributed so much to the
present splendour of our green-houses, were unknown to our English
botanists, but by name, till the above æra. In the year 1772 seeds of
two species were sent from the Cape.--Both vegetated. The first was the
E. tubiflora of the Sp. Plant. of Linnæus, the other the E. concinna. In
1774 the superb collection at Kew was enriched by nearly 20 species sent
by Mr. F. Masson, His Majesty’s collector at the Cape, for which we
refer to the 2nd vol. of the Catalogue of that garden. From this period,
till within these few years, the accession has been so rapid, so many
different collectors producing new species, that it would be only a list
of names to enumerate them, and no way illustrate the present subject;
nor would it be any way relevant to the subject, to know how many were
enumerated by Petiver, Plukenet, Hermann, Oldenland, Ray, &c. &c. as,
before Linnæus had by his mode of classification determined the precise
limits of the Genus, the confusion that then pervaded all the elder
botanists is such, that any comment from them would rather perplex than
elucidate. Therefore, beginning with the Systema Naturæ of Linnæus, vol.
ii. of 1767, including the European species, he there enumerates but 42;
and Dahlgren, in 1770, edited a dissertation (under his inspection) on
the Genus, containing a catalogue of 58 names from Bergius, the
Mantissa, &c. Thunberg, on his return from Africa, added 13 to the
number, all of which were inserted in the Supplementum Plantarum of
1781. From this and some other sources Murray has in his Syst. Veg. of
1784 made a list of 74 names, and Martyn in his edition of Miller’s
Dictionary, 1795, enumerates but 84. Willdenow, collating from all the
foregoing, &c., has mounted the list to 137 in his Species Plantarum.
This is certainly far short of the number at present cultivated in
Britain; and from the variety of beautiful new specimens and seeds
lately received by G. Hibbert, Esq. from his collector at the Cape, many
of which have vegetated and are in high perfection at the Clapham
Gardens, we may fairly conjecture that the Genus is by no means bounded
by the species we at present possess.




MODE OF CULTURE.


Very few, if any, of the species, but have been increased by cuttings.
The only method we shall therefore treat of is this, and by seeds. The
process for making and planting the cuttings is as follows: Let a
middle-sized pot be prepared by filling it within three inches of the
margin with small broken potsherds, or some such matter, that there may
be a constant and ready drain for the water, which it will be necessary
to give the cuttings at any time when the earth appears dry. Then,
consulting the Index, take a sufficient quantity of sandy loam, sandy
peat, or common sand, or a mixture of any of them, finely sifted, to
fill the pot up to the margin, and press it lightly with the hand. Thus
prepared, it is fit to receive the cuttings. These must be taken about
an inch long, or shorter, from the smallest and tenderest shoots,
cutting off the leaves two-thirds of the length, close to the shoot.
When a few are thus made ready, take a small pointed piece of wood and
dibble them into the pot; fixing the lower end of the cutting as firm as
possible. When the pot is filled with them at about half an inch
distance each way, cover them with a small bell-glass, to fit as near as
possible. Then place it under a large hand-glass, or frame, where it
must be kept from the stronger rays of the sun till the cuttings are
rooted. Soon after the small bell-glass must be first removed, and in a
week they may be exposed to the open air in the shade of a north wall,
or, in winter, in the shady part of the green-house, to protect them
from the sun and winds till they are removed into separate pots. The
seeds of some species which ripen in this country, as well as those
procured from the Cape, may be sown about the middle of March, in pots
prepared the same way as for the cuttings; with this exception, that the
earth be invariably sandy peat finely sifted. The seeds should be very
slightly covered, and watered with a pot whose rose or head should only
admit the water like a light dew, lest the seeds be all washed together.
The smallest pots that can be procured are the best for transplanting.
The earth in which most Heaths thrive best is a soft, loose, sandy
peat.
